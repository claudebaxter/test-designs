### <a href=https://claudebaxter.github.io/test-designs/book-list.html title="Book List">Book List:</a>

This is a simple HTML and JavaScript web page that displays a list of books with their titles and authors. The page uses modern CSS techniques, including flexbox and grid layouts, to create an organized and visually appealing display for desktop and mobile devices. Each book entry has a toggle button to show or hide the author's name. The page is self-contained within a single HTML file and is a demonstration of front-end development skills using ES6 syntax. Infinite scrolling has been implemented so that the books are loaded in batches of 10 each time the user scrolls to the bottom.
